    <h2>What is Mapo Tofu?</h2>
    <p>Mapo Tofu is a Chinese dish consisting of broad bean paste, ground pork, tofu, fermented black beans, and the mouth-numbing sichuan peppercorns
        (also know as prickly ash).</p>
    <p>Mapo tofu is the best-known dish of the Sichuan region of China and is famous for imparting both hot spicy and a mouth-numbing sensation from the floral
    peppercorns that garnish this iconic dish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200 g medium firm tofu</li>
            <li>150 g fatty ground pork</li>
            <li>30 mL neutral oil</li>
            <li>75 g Pixian broad bean paste</li>
            <li>40 g fermented black beans (preferably dry)</li>
            <li>2 tsp Sichuan peppercorns, toasted until fragant and ground into a coarse powder in a mortar and pestle or coffee grinder</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the Sichuan peppercorns dry into a small cast iron pan on medium-high heat and roast until fragrant (peppercorns will also darken slightly in colour)
            Grind to a coarse powder when finished.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large wok on medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add broad bean paste and fermented black beans and cook until the paste dries slightly
            and begins to stick to the bottom of the pan. It will almost seem to be burnt on, but should not smell of burning or dry out.
        </li>
        <li>Add the ground pork and reduce heat to medium, stiring pork to break it up into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Cube the tofu while the pork is cooking and add it to the wok, stirring gently to incorporate the sauce while preserving the shape</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, place into serving bowls, garnishing with the ground Sichuan peppercorns.</li>
    </ol>
