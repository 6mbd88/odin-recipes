    <h2>What is sourdough bread?</h2>
    <p>Sourdough bread is bread risen with fermented flour and water in place of traditional commercial yeast.</p>
    <p>It requires significantly more time to create, as the starter - a combination of flour and water left at room temperature to ferment - requires monitoring 
        and preparation in advance of being used as a leavening agent in baking. However, sourdough breads tend to have more unique flavours due to the heterogenous
        nature of the starter</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <!-- practice using unordered list -->
    
    <strong>Starter</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>200g flour</li>
        <li>200g water, room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Dough</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>30g starter</li>
        <li>400g flour</li>
        <li>300g water</li>
        <li>30g salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <!-- practice using ordered list -->
    Starter
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the flour and water together and leave in a warm place for 48-72 hours</li>
        <li>Check each day for signs of fermentation (e.g., bubbling a sour smell, etc.</li>
        <li>After signs of fermentation appear, add equal parts flour and water to your starter each day until it is 300g</li>
    </ol>
    Dough
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together all ingredients and leave on the counter at room temperature covered with plastic wrap or a tea towel for 2 hours</li>
        <li>Check after 1 hour - the dough should be roughly doubled in size</li>
        <li>If it is not doubled in size, cover again and check in another hour</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Farenheit and place an enamled cast iron pot inside to preheat</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, turn your dough out on the counter gently and score it.</li>
        <li>Remove the preheated pot from the oven and place the bread inside, covering with the lid</li>
        <li>Bake inside the oven for 35 to 50 minute, or until bread reaches an internal temperature for 209 degrees Farenheit</li>
        <li>Cool 20 minutes before cutting</li>
    </ol>
